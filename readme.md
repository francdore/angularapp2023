Project Idea: Movie Recommendation App

Description:
Create a movie recommendation app using Vue 3. Users should be able to search for movies, view movie details, and get personalized recommendations based on their preferences.

Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Allow users to sign up and log in to the app.
Movie Search: Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for movies by title, genre, or any other relevant criteria.
Movie Details: Display detailed information about a selected movie, including title, description, release date, rating, and any other relevant details.
User Ratings and Recommendations: Allow users to rate movies they have watched and use this data to provide personalized movie recommendations to each user.
Responsive Design: Ensure that the app is mobile-friendly and adapts well to different screen sizes.
Additional Challenges (Optional):
To further demonstrate your skills, you can add additional features or challenges to the project:

Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the movie search results.
Include a feature for users to create and manage their own movie watchlists.
Use a third-party movie API to fetch movie data, such as TMDB API.
Implement real-time updates using WebSockets to show the number of people currently watching a movie.
By building this project, you'll showcase your proficiency in Vue 3, demonstrate your ability to handle data management, user authentication, and deliver a responsive and interactive user experience.

Remember to pay attention to code organization, component reusability, and following best practices for Vue development. Additionally, consider writing unit tests to showcase your understanding of testing Vue components.
